# deadlineaware
This repository is for research on reinforcement learning algorithms for deadline-aware data transfer scheduling.
The task for deadline-aware data transfer is implemented as a class for environment. Reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented as a class for agent. Classical scheduling algorithm such as EDF and FCFS are also implemented as a class for agent.
